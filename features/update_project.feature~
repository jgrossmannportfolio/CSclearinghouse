	As a project owner
	So that I can keep my project information up to date
	I want to be able to update the project information and description

Background: projects on website and users registered

	Given the test users exist
	Given the test projects exist
	Given I am signed in as the following authenticated user:
		|username |firstname |lastname |email          |password|password_confirmation|
		|testuser1|user1first|user1last|user1@gmail.com|password|password             |

	Given testuser1 has created Project4
	And I am on the Projects Page
	When I follow "Details" for "Project4"
	And I should see "Project4"	
	Then I should be on the Details Page for Project4
	When I print page
	When I press "Update"
	Then I should be on the Edit Page for Project4
	And I fill in "Owner" with "Santa Claus"
	And I fill in "New Tag" with "testtag"
	When I press "Update Project Info"
	Then I should be on the Details Page for Project4
	And I should see "testtag"
	When I press "Update"
