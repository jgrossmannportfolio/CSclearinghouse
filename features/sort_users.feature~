Feature: sort users by various attributes

As a site user
So that I can find information about users faster
I want to be able to sort all the users by attributes, such as title, owner name, and deadline.

Background:

	Given the sort test projects exist
	
	Given the sort test users exist 
	  	
	Given I am signed in as the following authenticated user:
		|username |firstname |lastname |email          |password|password_confirmation|
		|atestuser1|buser1first|cuser1last|user1@gmail.com|password|password   |

Scenario: Sort all users by username
	Given I am on the users page
	And I should be on the users page
	And I follow "Username"
	When I print page
	Then I should see "atestuser1" before "ctestuser3"

Scenario: Sort all users by firstname
	Given I am on the users page
	And I follow "First Name"
	Then I should see "ctestuser3" before "atestuser1"

Scenario: Sort all users by lastname
	Given I am on the users page
	And I follow "Last Name"
	Then I should see "ctestuser3" before "atestuser1"

Scenario: Sort all users by email
	Given I am on the users page
	And I follow "Email"
	Then I should see "atestuser1" before "ctestuser3"
